## üìù Usage

### Goal Structure

export const goals = {
  6: {  // 6-month mark
    muggle: [
      { id: "6-m-1", area: "Academic", text: "Complete online course X" },
      // ... more goals
    ],
    monk: [
      // ... monk level goals
    ],
    god: [
      // ... god level goals
    ]
  },
  12: {  // 12-month mark
    // ... similar structure
  },
  18: {  // 18-month mark
    // ... similar structure
  }
};
```
